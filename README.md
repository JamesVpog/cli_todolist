## What is a todo list? 
[todo list](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/to-do_list): 
A list of errands and other tasks – often written on a piece of paper as a memory aid – that one needs or intends to accomplish.

## Why did I make a todo cli app?
This was a fun hobby project to learn Go and flags and I don't like leaving my terminal. It ~~might~~ does have bugs, so feel free to open an issue or PR.
